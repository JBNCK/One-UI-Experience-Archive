# JBNCK One UI Experience
Get the JBNCK One UI Experience on your Samsung Phone without root. Works best on Galaxy A-Series phones running Android 11 or 12
## Features
- Debloated and clean (pleasant for the eyes, fun to use and allows for 2-day battery life)\*
- Privacy (RethinkDNS [DNS + Firewall] and Privacy indicators included)\*\*
- Degoogled\*\*\* (removed the majority of Google apps, replaced Play Store client [AuroraStore], possibility to add accounts on DAVx5, included Chromium)
- Advanced tweaking (SystemUI Tuner included)
- Lightweight replacements for system apps
## Installation \*\*\*\*
For best results, make sure your device is freshly set up. If it isn't, create a backup (on anything but Google (WhatsApp backup is fine) or Samsung since those sync adapters will be removed) and perform a factory reset. Otherwise it may break your setup and you might end up with a chaotic system which defeats the whole purpose of the project ;) \
To start the installation, download the file (if you're on XDA) or download the newest release (if you're on GitHub) and unzip the file. On your phone, make sure you have USB debugging enabled. After enabling USB debugging connect your phone to your computer via a USB cable and execute the script (there are 3 files, choose the one that suits your operating system).
## Troubleshooting
### Bootloop
Hope you backed up your data :). Enter recovery mode and perform a factory reset
### Hey some app isn't working!
Ask me for help on XDA by posting a comment under the thread. Make sure to include information like:
1. What isn't working?
2. What device are you using?
3. Is there any error message that might help?
I will try to recreate the problem and send you a solution if i manage to solve it
### Hey some app that I use is missing!
Ask me for help on XDA by posting a comment under the thread. Make sure to include information like:
1. What app is missing?
2. What device are you using?
I will send you a command to get the app back since it has probably been removed by the script. I hope you know how to execute adb commands.
## Read this before you scream in the comments
Some features will get broken by the debloating process. This is completely normal so don't flip out when you see a settings toggle doing nothing. If you want to get a feature back, ask me.  
\* - battery life may/will depend on your phone model and installed apps  
\*\* - both need to be set up first. Also make sure to enable always on VPN for RethinkDNS  
\*\*\* - critical system apps as well as Google Play Services cannot be removed without root.
\*\*\*\* - adb will be blocked by MacOS by default. You can unblock it in the security tab in the settings app
